# Personal Finance Manager (Java Swing Application)

## Overview

This is a Java-based desktop application developed with the Swing framework. It offers users a streamlined way to manage personal finances through budgeting, data analysis, and intelligent financial assistance. The system is modular in design, ensuring clarity, extensibility, and maintainability.

### Key Modules

- **BudgetObserver**: Tracks user expenditures in real time against customized budgets. Alerts are issued when spending nears or exceeds defined thresholds, and monthly reports are generated for financial review.
- **AIConsultant**: An integrated advisory module that offers personalized financial advice based on user queries. It interfaces with an external AI API and provides actionable, context-aware suggestions.
- **CSVImporter**: Enables efficient importing of transaction data from user-provided CSV files, including automatic field mapping and validation.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built using Java Swing, the GUI allows users to interact with their financial data intuitively through multiple panels, including budgets, analytics, and consultation.

## System Architecture

```
+------------------+       +---------------------+       +----------------------+
|     Swing GUI    | <---> |   Core Service Layer| <---> | External AI Platform |
|  (User Interface)|       |  (Budget, CSV, Logic)|      |  (e.g., OpenAI API)  |
+------------------+       +---------------------+       +----------------------+
```

The application separates concerns between interface, logic, and integration for clear development and maintenance.
